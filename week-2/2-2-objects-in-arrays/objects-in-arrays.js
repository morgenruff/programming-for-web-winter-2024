// Description:
// 
// You are going to combine your knowledge of arrays with your knowledge of objects to create a (drum-roll please) array of objects! ðŸŽ‰
// 
// Steps:
// 
// Create an array with your favorite games as objects inside of the array. Each game object will represent one game.
// 
// Each object will have the same properties. I recommend title, type, numberOfPlayers, rating, shortDescription. Please note, the naming convention of object properties is camelCase.
// 
// You must have 3 or more games in the collection
// 
// Prompt the user with a message like "I have 3 games in my collection. Pick a number between 1 and 3 and I'll tell you about that game"
// 
// Cast the prompt to a number (if possible)
// 
// Using the plus sign as a concatenation operator, alert the user to you game. "You selected" + myGameArray[promptResponse -1 ].title + " which is a " + myGameArray[promptResponse - 1].type + " of game..." And so forth.
// 
// Add your exercise files to your git repo and commit your changes. Push to github. Upload to your MCAD hosting and share a link to that url in this discussion. Ensure that URL is accessible and functional.
